## How AI Is Discovering Athletes That Human Scouts Miss | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKu0yybmtkc)

Now, I'm going to begin by getting you to **visualize sporting greatness**. And what do you see? It's probably athletes like **LeBron James**, **Caitlin Clark**, **Saquon Barkley**, **Simone Biles**, **Ronaldo**, and **Messi**.
You see, we tend to associate athletes with a *small subset of countries*, so I’d forgive you for thinking that the best talent in the world only comes from those places.

But that’s not entirely true. *Talent exists long before sporting greatness emerges, and countless factors must align for athletes to realize their potential.* One crucial aspect that’s often overlooked is **opportunity and visibility**. You see, **talent exists everywhere**, but **finding** that talent is the real challenge.

So, how do we do that? Typically, the answer lies in **scouting**. It's every young athlete’s dream to be scouted. You picture that *old man sitting in the bleachers, jotting notes, and later calling you for a trial*. It’s a thrilling fantasy for so many. But there are only so many scouts.

Now, I’m from the **UK**, where **Chelsea Football Club** has one of the most prestigious and well-funded **youth academy programs** in the world. Yet, each **Premier League team** or **scout** can only evaluate about **2,000 players per year**, while *millions play the game*. Even within that small pool, opportunities are limited by **geography**, **financial cost**, and **accessibility**.

In recent years, many young athletes have taken matters into their own hands by **uploading clips of their best plays on social media**. But now, we’ve simply replaced a human scout with an **algorithm**—one that isn’t designed for **talent identification**. *So how do we fix this imbalance?*

It’s impossible for Chelsea or any other club to manually evaluate every potential athlete worldwide — *or is it?*

Today, **technologies like Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning** are helping us bridge that gap. Personally, I’m not a scout or a coach; my field is **biomechanics** — *the science of human motion*. Professionals in my field work in **sports laboratories** or with clubs to enhance **athletic performance** and reduce **injury risk**.

One day, while I was working in my lab, **Darren Peries**—who would later become our **Founder and CEO**—came in with his son, **Reef**, who was struggling with an injury. As we analyzed him using our advanced equipment, Darren and I started discussing the **scouting problem**.

He observed how **unfair and biased** scouting could be. Entire futures were often determined in a single day by a single opinion, *with minimal data to support the decision*. Then he asked, *“What if we could take all this lab-grade data and equipment and turn them into standardized smartphone-based drills—so any kid, anywhere in the world, could be tested fairly and equitably?”*

For me, that was a **brilliant vision** addressing a **genuine global issue**. So, I joined his team at **ai.io**, where we build **AI-driven solutions for sports**.

Our first innovation was **aiScout**, designed specifically to solve this problem. Here’s how it works: a young athlete downloads the app for free and records themselves performing **predefined athletic drills** directly from their smartphone. The video is then analyzed using **cloud-based computer vision AI**.

The system analyzes **22 key body segments**, transforming **2D videos into inferred 3D motion data**. From that, we extract detailed **performance metrics** such as *running direction, turning mechanics, jump height, speed, symmetry, and coordination*.

However, collecting raw data is only one part of the puzzle. *The real challenge lies in interpreting that data and assigning accurate scores that reflect an athlete’s potential.*

Moreover, **specificity** is key. Each **team**, **scout**, or **coach** values different traits. For instance, in **football (soccer)**, one club may prioritize **power and pace**, while another may focus on **technique, coordination, and movement control**. Therefore, aiScout must be **customized on a club-by-club basis**.

To ensure relevance, we partnered with **Burnley Football Club** and **Chelsea Football Club**—two **Premier League teams**—and asked them: *“If we could analyze any player globally using smartphone data, what metrics would matter to you?”*

Their answer was clear: *comparable, benchmarkable, and reliable data.* Above all, both scouts and players must understand **where the data comes from**—there can be *no ambiguity*.

We developed **predefined drills** in collaboration with them—**10-meter sprints**, **counter-movement jumps**, **cone dribbling**, **passing**, and **shooting**. These are genuine, measurable activities scouts use for performance assessment.

Next, we worked directly with scouts to understand their **intuitive decision-making process**. We compared videos—*“Do you prefer Player A or Player B?”*—and while scouts often chose correctly, they struggled to *explain why.*

So, we transformed their insights into **quantifiable scoring algorithms** and processed **thousands of videos** to establish **benchmarks and standards** across **age** and **gender**. After all, comparing a **13-year-old** to a **22-year-old** isn’t fair—metrics must be age-specific to highlight truly exceptional talent.

And speaking of exceptional talent, I’ll never forget when we were testing the app with **50 college players in the UK**. Most were average footballers—except one, *Ben*.

He stood out immediately. At just 17, he was extraordinary. The astonishing part? He lived only minutes from **Chelsea FC’s training ground** yet had never been scouted. *He wasn’t in a remote village; he was right there—just unseen.*

That’s when we knew our system worked. Ben received a trial at Chelsea, scored in his **under-18 debut**, later signed with another **Premier League club**, and even went on to **represent his country**.

But we didn’t stop there. *We wanted this technology to reach everyone, everywhere.*

Because all the **data processing, analysis, and modeling** occur in the **cloud**, it doesn’t matter whether you’re in **London** or **Mumbai**. If you have **a smartphone and an internet connection**, **aiScout** can identify your potential.
