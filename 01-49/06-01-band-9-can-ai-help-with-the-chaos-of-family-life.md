# Can AI Help with the Chaos of Family Life? | Avni Patel Thompson | TED - YouTube

On a Tuesday afternoon, I immerse myself in a complex product design in my home office, headphones on, focus sharp. A notification from Nora, our nanny, breaks through my Do Not Disturb mode: “Hey, Avni, can I take Thursday off?” I mute it, planning to respond later, and check my inbox for an email. Six unread messages about basketball, rehearsals, and a field trip test my restraint, but I leave them unopened, trusting my mental note to follow up.

Two minutes later, another message from Nora: “I’m at school for pickup, but no one’s here. Am I in the wrong place?” Panic surges. I verify the day and time, suspecting a mix-up with play rehearsal. Scouring emails, I find a note buried in the schedule: today’s rehearsal is in the music room, not the gym. I text Nora to head there, relieved, but those unread emails linger, tempting me.

This chaos isn’t rare. With two kids, dual careers, and a whirlwind of school events, soccer games, and lost library books, my brain became our family’s operating system. Collaboration suffered; my husband relied on me to delegate tasks, straining our partnership. As a former scientist and product designer turned tech founder, I saw opportunity in this friction. I’d built solutions before—like child-resistant yet arthritis-friendly drug packaging or SMS-based babysitter services. Parenthood, however, was friction’s ultimate challenge.

I envisioned an AI sidekick to intercept interruptions, so I created Milo, leveraging advanced large language models. Unlike rigid software, Milo handles ambiguity, adding birthday party invites to my calendar, reminding me to buy gifts, or flagging schedule conflicts. It processes school newsletters, grocery lists, and library due dates, sharing updates with everyone involved. Milo freed me from repetitive tasks, but I wanted more—playdate coordination, conflict resolution for my kids. An investor suggested automating sitter bookings, birthday messages, and teacher emails.

Yet, something felt off. One evening, my daughter Saaya showed me her clay art project. Running my fingers over its rough edges, I realized not all friction is bad. Productive friction—like scoring clay to bond pieces—creates connection. I didn’t need an impenetrable AI shield but a selective one, filtering out administrative noise while preserving meaningful interactions. Milo can suggest playdate times, but I’ll text Carrie to check on her mom. It can summarize newsletters but highlight Miss V’s note about Arya’s writing.

Your balance may differ, and mine shifts with circumstances. During a hectic week—husband traveling, nanny sick, tennis tryouts, product launch—I want Milo’s force field airtight. AI’s radical potential lies not in automating everything but in empowering us to choose what matters. Milo makes space for me to embrace the messy, human moments, reminding us to value our imperfect, evolving selves.
