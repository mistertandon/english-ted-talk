As I survey the room, nearly half of you are circulating a potent hormone through your bloodstream—testosterone, which permeates your cells, including neurons, influencing both physical and neurological development. This chemical exerts profound effects on body and behavior. While both sexes produce it, men typically have 15 to 20 times more, explaining key sexual dimorphisms such as size and hair distribution.

Testosterone plays a central role in my field of behavioral endocrinology, where hormones and behavior intersect. For two decades, I’ve studied how this hormone, in particular, elucidates sex differences. However, this science is often fraught with cultural controversy, especially when discussing biological sex. Recognizing two reproductive classes—male and female—can spark backlash. This is particularly distressing for transgender individuals and their allies, who may find these discussions unsettling, especially when biology is weaponized.

Despite this, students consistently find value in understanding the biological underpinnings of sex, which fosters empathy and deepens self-awareness. Today, I will focus on sex differences in behavior, particularly in play, to illustrate the fascinating nature of this science and its implications for well-being.

Fifteen years ago, I embarked on a collaborative project: gestating two testosterone-producing organs within my uterus. These organs were part of a human I was cultivating—my son. This video, featuring him wrestling with another boy, exemplifies rough-and-tumble play, a behavior universally more prevalent among males. While developing in utero, my son’s testes produced testosterone, which masculinized his genitalia and brain, setting the stage for such behaviors. This kind of play prepares male mammals for future competition, something I observed firsthand while studying wild chimpanzees in Uganda. Young male chimpanzees also engage in more play fighting than females, despite their lack of cultural influences—proving the biological basis of such behaviors. Testosterone and its role in fostering social dominance competitions are shared across species, including humans.

Interestingly, male chimpanzees aren't consciously fighting for mating opportunities. Yet, those who exhibit more aggressive tendencies often pass on more genes, with their sons inheriting similar behaviors. Evolution favors not just survival, but reproductive success, and young animals—like our own children—practice reproductive skills through play.

This rough play is not uniform, however. Some boys prefer gentler activities, like playing house, which is equally valid. Nature imposes no strict rules on gendered play. Growing up, I participated in both rough-and-tumble play with my brothers and quieter activities with friends. Regardless, all play fosters crucial social skills—conflict resolution, turn-taking, and understanding boundaries. While culture influences the specifics, certain behaviors, like nurturing in girls and aggression in boys, likely evolved to enhance reproductive success.

Experimental evidence strongly supports testosterone’s role in driving these behaviors. Studies in rats and monkeys show that females exposed to higher testosterone levels engage in more rough play, while suppressing testosterone in males diminishes such behavior. In humans, indirect evidence, particularly from girls exposed to elevated testosterone in utero, corroborates these findings—they tend to prefer rough play as well.

However, it’s important to contextualize these behaviors. One mother, opposing rough play, argued it reinforces toxic masculinity. Yet, depriving boys of such play might hinder their development. Studies show that rats deprived of rough play struggle to regulate aggression, interpret social cues, and mate, highlighting the evolutionary importance of these behaviors.

Ultimately, while we share many biological traits with animals, our capacity for self-reflection and culture allows us to regulate destructive tendencies. Cultural differences, as seen between Canadian and American men, prove that behavior is not dictated solely by testosterone. Misrepresenting the science of sex would be detrimental, as traditional male behaviors often reflect healthy development. We should embrace the science of sex, fostering a culture where children engage in real-world play, ideally outdoors.
