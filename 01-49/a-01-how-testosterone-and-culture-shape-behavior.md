As I scan the audience, it’s evident that many of you are currently influenced by elevated levels of a potent chemical circulating throughout your body. This compound penetrates nearly all your cells, including neurons, affecting their survival, growth, and functioning. The chemical in question is testosterone, a hormone produced by both men and women, though men have about 15 to 20 times more. This disparity accounts for the average physical differences between sexes.

For over two decades, I’ve taught behavioral endocrinology, a field exploring the intricate relationship between hormones and behavior. Testosterone particularly intrigues me due to its ability to explain many behavioral differences between sexes. However, discussing such biological distinctions has become increasingly controversial in today’s socio-political climate. Even the basic scientific fact that males and females are distinct reproductive classes can provoke backlash. I acknowledge that these discussions can distress some individuals, particularly within transgender communities, when science is weaponized to undermine their identities.

Despite this, my students frequently find great value in learning about these concepts, as it deepens their understanding of themselves and fosters empathy for others. Today, I’ll explore sex-based behavioral differences, particularly in play, and how science can illuminate these patterns for the greater good.

Fifteen years ago, I began a personal experiment by nurturing two small organs inside me—organs that secreted testosterone as part of a developing human. (Laughter) You’ll see the result in this video, where my son engages in rough-and-tumble play—an activity far more common in boys than girls. While he was still developing, his testes produced testosterone, which masculinized his body and brain, shaping behaviors such as play fighting that offer evolutionary advantages.

My understanding of these dynamics deepened during a year-long study of chimpanzees in Uganda, where I observed that young male chimps engage in significantly more play fighting than females. Like humans, male chimps also invest more in social dominance, constantly competing for status through displays of aggression. Interestingly, these behaviors are not conscious attempts to secure mates, but males who exhibit them tend to pass on their genes more effectively, with their sons inheriting similar tendencies. This reflects the evolutionary principle: mere survival without reproduction is an evolutionary dead end.

While observing chimps, I noticed that testosterone-driven behaviors like rough play were vital for young males to develop reproductive skills. Human children mirror this dynamic. However, boys' rough play does not foreshadow toxic masculinity; rather, it represents healthy development. Scientific experiments with animals corroborate this, showing that elevated testosterone in female rats and monkeys enhances rough play, while suppressing it in males reduces such behavior.

Though humans cannot ethically manipulate fetal hormone exposure, studies of girls exposed to higher levels of testosterone in utero reveal they also engage in more rough play, further supporting the hormone’s role in shaping behavior. Cultural influences undoubtedly play a role in how children express these behaviors, but evolutionary pressures and hormonal effects are undeniable.

It is crucial that we not suppress healthy play behaviors due to misplaced fears of toxic masculinity. Boys need opportunities for physical play to learn important social cues and self-regulation. For example, male rats deprived of rough play grow into adults who struggle with aggression control, harming their social and reproductive success.

Humans, of course, possess the unique capacity to reflect on and manage our impulses, but that doesn't negate the need for children to engage in play. Science demonstrates that traditional male play behaviors are essential for healthy development and should be encouraged—not stifled. (Applause)
