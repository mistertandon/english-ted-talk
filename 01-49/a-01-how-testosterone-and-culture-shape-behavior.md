As I observe the audience, it's clear many of you are influenced by heightened levels of testosterone circulating throughout your bodies. This hormone, produced by both men and women—though in much larger quantities in men—affects various physiological functions, including behavior. Testosterone is a key factor in the physical differences between the sexes.

For over 20 years, I've taught behavioral endocrinology, studying how hormones impact behavior. Testosterone fascinates me because it explains many of the behavioral differences observed between men and women. However, discussing these biological distinctions has become increasingly controversial. The simple fact that males and females are distinct reproductive classes can provoke backlash, particularly from transgender communities, where science is often misused to undermine their identities.

Despite this, my students find value in understanding these concepts, as it enhances their self-awareness and empathy. Today, I'll discuss sex-based behavioral differences, especially in play, and how science can provide insight into these patterns for societal benefit.

Fifteen years ago, I began an experiment by nurturing two organs that produce testosterone—my son’s testes. You’ll see the result in this video, where he engages in rough play, a behavior far more common in boys. His testosterone shaped his body and brain, fostering behaviors like play fighting, which offer evolutionary benefits.

My research deepened during a study of chimpanzees in Uganda. Young male chimps engage in more rough play than females, and like humans, they compete for social dominance. These behaviors are not conscious attempts to attract mates but are linked to reproductive success. Males who display dominance behaviors tend to pass on their genes, a key principle of evolution.

I noticed that testosterone-driven behaviors, like rough play, help young males develop reproductive skills. Human boys follow a similar pattern. However, such behaviors do not equate to toxic masculinity; they are part of healthy development. Animal studies support this, showing that testosterone increases rough play in females and that its absence in males reduces such behavior.

Although we cannot ethically manipulate fetal hormone levels, studies show that girls exposed to higher testosterone in the womb also engage in more rough play, underscoring the hormone's influence. While cultural factors affect how children express these behaviors, evolutionary pressures and hormones play undeniable roles.

We must not suppress natural play behaviors due to concerns about toxic masculinity. Boys need physical play to develop social skills and self-regulation. For instance, male rats deprived of rough play struggle with aggression in adulthood, hindering their social success.

Humans possess the ability to manage our impulses, but this does not diminish the need for play. Science confirms that traditional male play behaviors are vital for healthy development and should be encouraged.
