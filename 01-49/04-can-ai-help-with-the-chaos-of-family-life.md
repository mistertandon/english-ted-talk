# Can AI Help with the Chaos of Family Life? | Avni Patel Thompson

In this captivating discourse, anchored in AI product architecture and anthropocentric computing, the orator delineates a tumultuous afternoon that catalyzed a profound epiphany regarding the cognitive burden contemporary parents endure. Inundated by disjointed familial logistics and incessant disruptions, she initially endeavored to delegate family orchestration to an inflexible system. Nevertheless, conventional software proved inadequate in accommodating the capricious and subtle intricacies of quotidian existence.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), she discerned a prospect. These models could decipher vague, equivocal inputs and manage tacit responsibilities—such as procuring gifts or scrutinizing for scheduling incongruities. This realization precipitated the development of Milo, an AI-driven assistant meticulously crafted to oversee familial obligations by processing correspondence, arranging engagements, and disseminating updates effortlessly.

Yet, as Milo’s proficiencies expanded—encompassing even social exchanges and parental discourse—she experienced disquiet. The revelation materialized through her daughter’s ceramic creation: not all friction is deleterious. She apprehended that certain inefficiencies, or constructive friction, are vital for human interconnectedness. An overly rigid automation framework might eradicate an excess of meaningful junctures.

Ultimately, she champions permeable automation—AI that sifts out unproductive tasks while safeguarding room for emotionally resonant interactions. Milo does not merely optimize efficiency; it fosters intentionality, endowing individuals with the liberty to prioritize what truly matters. This signifies a paradigm shift from constructing tools that amplify output to devising AI that buttresses authentic, flawed, and dynamic human existences.
