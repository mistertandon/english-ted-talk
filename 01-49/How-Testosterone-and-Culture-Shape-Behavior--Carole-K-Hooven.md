[How Testosterone and Culture Shape Behavior | Carole K. Hooven | TED - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYnZy2Cx7UM)


As I survey the room, I observe that approximately half of you have been exposed to elevated levels of a potent chemical, which is currently circulating through your bloodstream. This chemical permeates nearly all of your cells, including neurons, where it influences their survival, growth, and functionality.

This single compound exerts profound and enduring effects—not only on your body but also on your brain and behavior. The substance in question is testosterone. Although both sexes produce it, men possess significantly higher levels—about 15 to 20 times more than women. This disparity accounts for why, on average, half of you are larger and hairier than the other half, similar to other sexual dimorphisms.

For the past two decades, I have taught behavioral endocrinology, a field dedicated to understanding the bidirectional relationship between hormones and behavior. Testosterone, in particular, captivates my interest because it elucidates so much about the differences between the sexes. However, this scientific domain has become deeply enmeshed in cultural conflicts.

Today, simply stating what is self-evident to most biologists—that there are two reproductive classes, male and female—can incite significant controversy. I speak from personal experience when I say that these statements can provoke backlash. Additionally, I am acutely aware that for some transgender individuals, their allies, and others, discussions about the biology of sex can be distressing, especially when others attempt to weaponize this science.

While I do not claim to have all the answers, I can share that my students have found great value in learning about this subject. It not only enhances their understanding of their own bodies and emotions but also fosters a greater sense of empathy for those who are different from themselves. Today, I will discuss sex differences in behavior, particularly in play, to demonstrate that this science is both intriguing and capable of contributing to our collective well-being.



First, I want to share the outcomes of a collaborative project I initiated 15 years ago, during which I nurtured two small organs that secreted testosterone within my uterus. (Laughter) These organs were part of a new human I was cultivating. And now… (Laughter) (Applause) You can observe the behavior of that human in this video of two boys wrestling.

The video, taken a few years ago, features my son, who is the one with short hair. This type of rough-and-tumble play is universally more prevalent among boys than girls. While my son was developing inside me, his tiny testes were already producing testosterone, which, at that early stage, had critical functions.

It was responsible for masculinizing the genitalia and ensuring that the physiological mechanisms for sperm production and delivery were established. Additionally, it influenced the brain to later drive behaviors, such as play fighting, which are particularly advantageous for many male mammals. I hadn’t given much thought to testosterone until I spent nearly a year in western Uganda studying wild chimpanzees.

As I observed their daily activities—eating, playing, sleeping, fighting, and mating—I was profoundly struck by the parallels between their behavior and ours. Particularly relevant to this discussion is that young male chimpanzees engage in significantly more play fighting than their female counterparts. These behavioral similarities are compelling because, unlike humans, chimpanzees do not share our culture.

However, we do share nearly all of our genes and hormones, including the higher levels of testosterone found in males. Another behavioral pattern we share is that, compared to females, male chimpanzees invest considerably more time and energy in competing for social dominance. For chimps, this competition involves frequent fighting, displays of aggression, and an acute sense of when to challenge or submit to other males.

Interestingly, these males aren’t consciously fighting to secure more opportunities for mating with fertile females. Yet, males who exhibit these aggressive behaviors tend to pass on more of their genes to future generations, with their sons inheriting similar tendencies. Therefore, merely surviving without passing on one’s genes is an evolutionary dead end.




In addition to survival skills, young animals, such as chimpanzees, must also acquire reproductive skills, and they do so through play. Our ancestors similarly practiced these skills through play, a legacy that is evident in our own children. Of course, not all boys are inclined to engage in physical play like tackling their friends; some prefer to play house or dress up, and they should feel free to do so.

Nature imposes no rigid rules on how the sexes should play. When I was a child, I wrestled with my three older brothers and played Little League baseball. However, when I played with my girlfriends, like my best friend Annie—who was always the dominant one, as you can see in the stripes, and who is sitting right here—(Laughter) our play never involved the kind of roughhousing that my son and his friends enjoyed.

Annie and I preferred activities like having tea parties or running a classroom for our stuffed animals—the smallest of whom resided in a dollhouse. For some reason, we also enjoyed playing office. Yes, I know, it sounds bizarre. We developed a filing system (Laughter) and spent an inordinate amount of time filling out forms. I’m not exaggerating—filling out forms. Now, I’m about to publicly admit something I’ve never shared before, and I apologize in advance, Annie. You probably know what I’m about to say.

We filled out forms from junk mail, which we might have "borrowed" from neighborhood mailboxes. (Laughter) OK, wait. Am I seriously trying to argue that learning how to set up tea for five or subscribe to National Geographic was meant to make us better mothers or something? Not exactly. While the specifics of play are influenced by culture, social play, in general, helps both sexes develop essential skills, such as conflict resolution, taking turns, and figuring out what boundaries they can push.

However, the specialization of play—nurturing behaviors in girls and more aggressive play in boys—likely evolved because these skills are crucial for reproductive success. That provides a bit of evolutionary context, so now we can explore why scientists believe that testosterone plays a significant role in driving these behaviors.



Our most compelling evidence stems from experiments conducted on other animals. Here are some key findings: In female rats and monkeys, artificially elevating testosterone levels during early development significantly amplifies rough play. Conversely, in males, suppressing testosterone during the same developmental period leads to a marked decline in such behavior.

In humans, however, we cannot ethically manipulate fetal hormone exposure, so we rely on indirect evidence. Numerous studies have investigated the play behaviors of girls who were exposed to unusually high testosterone levels in utero. Consistently, these studies demonstrate that such girls exhibit a heightened preference for rough play.

While we still have much to learn about the intricate interplay between genes, hormones, and culture in shaping sex differences in behavior, all existing evidence points to a similar conclusion: variations in testosterone levels, coupled with evolutionary pressures, elucidate why boys, more than girls, are inclined to engage in rough-and-tumble play.

Let’s hypothesize that this behavior is indeed natural. But remember, it's also natural to reconnect with an ex-partner—(Laughter)—which doesn’t necessarily make it advisable. (Laughter) According to one mother who shared her perspective in a parenting magazine, rough play among boys is something that perhaps ought to be reconsidered. She wrote, “Allowing my boys to wrestle only reinforces toxic masculinity, and I want no part of it.”

One could argue that we might cultivate more peaceful men by curtailing their practice of aggression in childhood. However, the empirical evidence does not support this notion. For instance, male rats deprived of the opportunity to engage in rough play during their youth become adult males who never learn to regulate their aggressive tendencies. Paradoxically, they become more, rather than less, aggressive. These rats struggle to cooperate, fail to interpret social cues correctly, and ultimately, cannot secure mates. Having such maladjusted males in a population benefits no one. (Laughter)

Of course, we are neither rats nor chimpanzees. For one thing, if you men were chimpanzees, you’d be tearing each other apart.



If you were meeting for the first time, chaos would ensue. However, we humans possess a unique capability that sets us apart from other animals: the ability to reflect on, discuss, and collectively decide how to manage our more destructive impulses. Culture plays a pivotal role in this process. For instance, men in Canada exhibit significantly lower levels of violence compared to their counterparts just south of the border—except, perhaps, when it comes to hockey. (Laughter)

This difference isn’t because Canadian men lack testosterone or because Canadian boys abstain from roughhousing. Rather, it’s attributable to cultural distinctions, including perhaps variations in gun laws, healthcare systems, or levels of socioeconomic inequality.

As a society, we stand to lose much if we exclude the science of sex from the conversation or if we misrepresent the facts. The science strongly indicates that traditionally male play behaviors do not foreshadow toxic masculinity. Instead, they are manifestations of healthy development that we should not suppress. (Applause)

To exaggerate only slightly, the testosterone from those tiny testes I grew 15 years ago played a significant role in shaping my son into the person he is today. And he remains a remarkable individual, even as his testosterone levels reach new heights. (Laughter)

I want him, and all of you, to be enthralled by the science of sex and to feel comfortable discussing it. Lastly, I hope that all our children have more opportunities to engage in play, ideally in the real world rather than the virtual one, and preferably outdoors.
Thank you. (Applause and cheers)
