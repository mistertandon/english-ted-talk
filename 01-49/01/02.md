## How AI Is Unearthing Hidden Scientific Knowledge | Sara Beery | TED

Once the model is **trained**, it becomes an **extraordinarily powerful instrument**.
It can **rapidly** identify **new instances of birds consuming insects** across massive databases.
However … repeatedly collecting **hundreds or thousands of labeled examples** for every new query is still **inefficient**.

*So we must fundamentally **reframe how scientific discovery is conducted**.*

Scientific discovery begins with **curiosity** — with asking **precise questions** about how the **natural world** operates.
For example:
How far can a **Grant’s zebra** migrate?
Which **plant species** regenerate after a **wildfire**?
Do **birds consume insects** during winter?

*Would it not be far more powerful if scientists could **ask these questions directly** to their databases and receive **immediate answers**?*

That is exactly what my team at **MIT** has built.
We developed a system called **Inquire**, designed to enable **ecologists** to retrieve **scientific insight** directly from **data**, without writing **code** or creating **training sets**.

At its core, Inquire uses **multimodal artificial intelligence** — models that learn **semantic similarity** between **images** and **scientific language**.
This allows a scientist to simply **express a question**, rather than engineer a model.

Here is how it works.

An ecologist begins by formulating a **scientific hypothesis** and translating it into a series of **searchable concepts**.
One such concept might be **“bird eating insect.”**

Inquire then compares this phrase against **300 million images** in mere **seconds**.
It is engineered for **high-performance retrieval**, allowing the system to remain **fully interactive** while consuming far less **computational power** than **generative AI models**.

Once the images are ranked by **relevance**, scientists can immediately focus on the most **probable matches** and **validate** them.
This yields a collection of **human-verified ecological records**, ready for **export** and **statistical analysis**.

One of our collaborators used Inquire and uncovered **thousands of feeding events** — birds eating not only insects, but also **seeds, fruit, nectar, plants, carrion, and nuts**.
They then analyzed how **dietary composition** changes between **summer and winter**.

What they discovered was revealing.
**American robins** do consume insects in winter … but at far **lower rates** than in summer.
Species such as the **American tree sparrow**, which rely heavily on insects during summer, **eliminate them entirely** from their winter diet.

*This entire process — from **question to conclusion** — took only **three hours**.*

A traditional research team required **1,560 hours** to manually curate comparable data.

When the two studies were compared, the results showed **near-perfect concordance**.

*This demonstrates that **AI-driven discovery** can deliver **scientific rigor at unprecedented speed**.*

What is equally remarkable is the **creativity** of the scientists using the system.
They have investigated how **forests regenerate after fires**, how **mortality differs between urban and rural species**, and how **flowering cycles shift under climate change**.

*The scope of inquiry is virtually **limitless**.*

And this is only the beginning.

We have demonstrated this capability with **images**, but the same paradigm applies to **bioacoustics**, **aerial video**, **satellite imagery**, **GPS trajectories**, and **animal-borne sensors**.

All of these data streams capture **different dimensions of the same biosphere**.
They are **distinct yet complementary**, and together they form a **multilayered representation of life on Earth**.

I envision a future in which **AI systems** reveal **hidden correlations** across these modalities, uncovering ecological relationships that no human could manually detect.

Of course, this technology alone cannot solve the **global biodiversity crisis**.
However, it enables us to **extract maximal value** from the data we already possess.
That allows us to **identify knowledge gaps** and **strategically collect new data** where it matters most.

This reduces both the **time** and **cost** of generating the information that drives **conservation policy** — from managing **habitat corridors**, to protecting **breeding grounds**, to supporting **post-disaster recovery**.

*We are living in a pivotal moment in history.*

We face an **unprecedented ecological emergency**, yet we also possess **unprecedented analytical tools**.
Millions of people are contributing observations.
AI is revealing **patterns at planetary scale**.

The future of conservation is not hidden only in **rainforests** or **ocean trenches**.
It is embedded in our **ecological databases** — both present and future.

And every person has a role.

Every **photograph**, every **sound recording**, every **field observation** adds another piece to the puzzle.
With **scientific AI** in our toolkit, we can finally assemble a **complete picture of life on Earth** — and use it to **protect what remains**.
