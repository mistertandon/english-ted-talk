## How AI Is Unearthing Hidden Scientific Knowledge | Sara Beery | TED

Imagine you are a **doctor** trying to **save a patient’s life**, yet you can see only **one-fifth of their body** …
How would you **prescribe medication**?
How would you **perform surgery**?

*This is precisely the predicament humanity faces with the **biosphere**.*

We must **act immediately** to protect **fragile ecosystems**, yet our **biological knowledge** of Earth remains **profoundly incomplete**.

I am both an **AI researcher** and an **ecologist**, and as a **professor at MIT**, I lead a research group that develops **computational methods** to expand our understanding of the **natural world**.
I foresee a future in which **artificial intelligence** can **exponentially amplify** our **ecological intelligence** across **species, habitats, and ecosystems**.
*However, to reach that future, we must fundamentally **restructure how AI is applied in ecology**.*

We need **adaptive**, **interactive**, and **scientist-centered** algorithms that enable **knowledge discovery** hidden within **high-dimensional ecological data**.

Now … let me explain why this matters.

Scientists estimate that **approximately 10 million species** inhabit our planet.
Yet we have formally documented only **two million**.

*That means nearly **80 percent of Earth’s biodiversity** remains **unknown**.*

And to **protect a species**, knowing that it merely **exists** is not enough.
We must understand:

— **Where** it lives
— **What** it eats
— **Whether** it migrates
— **How far** it travels

This level of **biological insight** requires **long-term, longitudinal observation**, not isolated sightings.

Without such depth, we cannot identify **ecological vulnerability**.

Consider this scenario …
Insect populations across **North America** are **collapsing** — this is already happening.
What does that mean for **insect-eating birds**?
Which species will **adapt**, and which will **decline**?
What happens to the **predators** that feed on those birds?

*Because ecosystems are **interdependent networks**, the collapse of one population can **cascade**, ultimately **destabilizing the entire system**.*

Today, species are under pressure from **every direction**:
**Habitat destruction**, **climate change**, **water scarcity**, **wildfires**, and **biological invasion** are simultaneously eroding the planet’s **ecological resilience**.

As a result, **extinction rates** are now **100 to 1,000 times higher** than historical baselines.
**Scientists**, **policymakers**, and **communities** are scrambling to identify the **drivers of biodiversity loss** and implement **evidence-based interventions**.

Yet it often feels as though we are **discovering species only in time to document their extinction**.

Take the **Tapanuli orangutan**.
It was scientifically identified in **2017** — yet it was already **critically endangered** at the moment of discovery.

*Traditional field biology is simply **too slow** for a crisis of this magnitude.*

Now … here is the good news.

We are surrounded by **enormous ecological datasets** that remain **vastly underutilized**.

Consider **iNaturalist**, a global citizen-science platform.
More than **300 million images** have been uploaded by volunteers worldwide.
Each image contains a **species identification**, already generating **unprecedented species-occurrence data**.

But there is far more hidden within the **pixels**.

Look at this example …
It is labeled **Grant’s zebra**.

Yes — it confirms **where** and **when** the species was observed.
But it also reveals that **three individual zebras** appear in the image.
Their **unique stripe patterns** allow us to perform **individual-level identification**.

With this, we can track **movement**, **social structure**, **health**, **growth**, and even estimate **population size**.

The zebras are standing alongside **wildebeest**, and nearby we can detect an **oxpecker** — a bird that removes **parasites** and reduces **disease transmission**.

In the background, we can analyze **vegetation cover**, estimate **biomass**, and infer **carbon storage**.
We can even determine **dietary behavior**, helping us reconstruct a **local food web**.

*Now multiply this insight by **300 million images** — and then add*
**bioacoustic recordings** from **xeno-canto**,
**camera-trap datasets**,
and **deep-sea footage** from **FathomNet**.

We are sitting on an **ecological goldmine**.

The real challenge is **extracting knowledge at scale**.

At one second per image, it would take **40 years of full-time work** to manually review iNaturalist alone.

*This is why **artificial intelligence** is indispensable.*

AI allows us to **scan**, **classify**, and **interpret** this data at **machine speed**.

An ecologist studying **avian diets** can train a **machine-learning model** to locate images of **birds consuming insects**.
By providing **hundreds or thousands of labeled examples**, the model learns to **recognize ecological patterns** that humans could never process at scale.

And that is how **AI becomes a force multiplier for planetary survival**.
