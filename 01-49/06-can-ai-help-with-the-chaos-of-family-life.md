# Can AI Help with the Chaos of Family Life? | Avni Patel Thompson | TED - YouTube

On a certain Tuesday, I’m immersed in product ideation when a communiqué from our nanny, Nora, disrupts my focus: “May I absent myself this Thursday?” I silence the notification, yet another missive soon intrudes—she’s at the school for retrieval, perplexed about the whereabouts. A swift investigation unveils a rehearsal entanglement; I direct her to the conservatory. Managing two offspring, dual vocations, and a ceaseless cascade of academic functions, athletic contests, and misplaced tomes, I serve as our household’s cognitive nexus, and this role is taxing our alliance.

As a erstwhile savant and technology progenitor, I’ve grappled with impedance previously—devising inclusive pharmaceutical encasements and SMS-driven childcare solutions. Parenthood, nonetheless, presents the quintessential conundrum. I engineered Milo, an AI confederate leveraging sophisticated linguistic frameworks to navigate vagueness. Milo seamlessly integrates birthday convocations into my agenda, prompts me regarding presents, and sifts through bulletins, provisions inventories, and library deadlines, disseminating updates universally. It emancipates me from monotonous undertakings, enabling me to concentrate.

Yet, not all impedance is deleterious. One twilight, my daughter’s ceramic endeavor rekindles an insight: constructive friction—akin to amalgamating clay—fosters rapport. I honed Milo to sieve bureaucratic clamor while safeguarding poignant interludes. It proposes playdate schedules, yet I personally correspond with comrades; it condenses newsletters but highlights personal missives from educators.

Your equilibrium may diverge. Amid tumultuous intervals—peregrinations, an indisposed nanny, trials, or unveilings—I lean on Milo’s robust bulwark. AI’s potency lies not in mechanizing all facets but in augmenting volition, carving out niches for the chaotic, human episodes and our fallible essences.
