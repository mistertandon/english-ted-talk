## The Powerful Promise of Earth’s Harshest Places | Lei Zhang [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xn1C6ALvo)

This is **Inner Mongolia**… the **Gobi Desert**. *(Pause)* My favorite place. It is the most **Mars-like terrain on Earth**: barren… empty… windswept year-round. Sandstorms are frequent. In winter, temperatures drop to **minus 40 degrees Celsius**… in summer, they reach **40 degrees**. *By all practical measures, it seems useless.* *(Smile)* But… it remains my **most beloved place**.

If you look at that tiny dot over there… that’s me. *(Pause, small laugh)* I come to the Gobi with a belief: when people see **uselessness… barrenness… emptiness**… I see **abundance**. Look closely: this barren desert is brimming with **renewable energy**. The strong wind… the shining sun… they are **infinite**… and never-ending.

I discovered a critical equation connecting **energy** and **prosperity**. *(Pause)* Two thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, global GDP grew only fivefold. Why? Because we could only harness **five times more energy**—natural energy, agriculture, human muscle.

Since the Industrial Revolution… global GDP has expanded **100 times**. Why? Because we are using **100 times more energy**.

Abundant fossil fuels powered machines… created **steel**… generated **fertilizer** to boost food production… and today… they even drive **human intelligence**.

So… how can we unlock the **same potential from the desert**… to propel humanity into the **next era of prosperity**? One hour of solar radiation here can meet our **entire annual energy demand**. It is **free**… and **green**.

Facing the Gobi, we confront **three challenges**:

**First**: how can we capture **rough… raw wind energy**? Just as the steam engine converted coal into motion, we developed **wind turbines** to turn wind into electricity. *Most importantly*, these turbines must survive the desert’s **extreme wind conditions**.

**Second**: how can we avoid **costly, long-distance transmission lines**? Our solution: the **largest off-grid renewable system**, integrating **wind turbines… solar panels… storage… and AI orchestration**.

**Third**: how can we utilize this **abundant, local electricity**? We built **net-zero industrial parks** to produce **energy-intensive products**: batteries… green hydrogen… green ammonia.

Why green ammonia? One ton stores **10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity**. *Green molecules* are essential to decarbonize the **hardest sectors**. Green hydrogen will produce **green steel**… **net-zero chemicals**… **sustainable aviation fuel… and shipping fuel**.

Today… in the heart of the Gobi… the **first net-zero industrial park** is operational. Entirely off-grid. Powered **100% by renewable energy**. Producing **state-of-the-art batteries**… at the **lowest cost** worldwide. Why? Because the energy is **abundant… and free**.

We are also building the **largest green-hydrogen project in the world**: **1.5 million tons** of green hydrogen and ammonia. The first phase—**300,000 tons—is commissioning now**. Our goal? Not to be the biggest… but the **cheapest**. Achieving **grid parity** for green hydrogen.

Why is cost so critical? History shows: **GDP growth of 100 times** comes from **energy cost reduction**. Renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil-fuel electricity… but **green molecules** remain **2–3 times more expensive**.

To unlock this potential, we must **redesign the energy system… innovate equipment… and reduce costs dramatically**.

We designed **AI-regulated wind turbines** to capture more energy… at lower cost. We developed the **world’s first hybrid energy storage**, combining **lithium batteries** with **supercapacitors**, supporting the grid efficiently. Electrolyzers are more efficient thanks to **advanced membranes and electrodes**. Hydrogen plants are **modular and prefabricated**, making desert construction as easy as stacking **LEGO**. AI models predict **weather, wind, and solar output** to manage the grid automatically.

Today, we achieve the **lowest cost of green hydrogen and ammonia** globally. I believe by 2028, we will reach **grid parity** for molecules. Why am I confident? Over the last 20 years, **wind and solar costs dropped 90%**. Over the last five years, **energy storage costs dropped 90%**. Green electricity remains the main cost component… so combining **electrolyzer efficiency** and **hydrogen factory innovation**, cost parity is within reach.

Achieving this milestone removes the **last bottleneck**… unlocking **tremendous renewable energy**.

Imagine: in the next 100 years… harnessing **100 times more energy** could allow us to:

* Deploy **AI-powered superintelligence** everywhere.
* Desalinate seawater… **turn deserts into green oases**.
* Eliminate poverty… producing food and protein efficiently.
* Reverse the climate crisis… capturing carbon and turning it into **building materials**.
* Make **interstellar travel** a routine.

The answer lies in the desert. From the **Sahara** to the **Middle East… Australia… Gobi**—renewable energy is **infinite… green… and free**. The future depends on our **technology**.

Ladies and gentlemen, the **net-zero transition** is not a burden. It is the **pathway to unprecedented human prosperity**.
