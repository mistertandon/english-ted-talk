## A Practical Guide to Taking Control of Your Life | Cate Hall [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN07gbipMoY)


Five years ago, I was a prisoner in my own life. I was hopelessly addicted to drugs. Every morning, I would get up, buy drugs, and then spend the rest of the day using, barely conscious, until I passed out at night. I spent months living like that. I don’t have many memories from that time, but one stands out clearly: the intense awe and resentment I felt watching normal people live normal lives.

I would see someone meet a friend for lunch, and it seemed inconceivable that anyone could be that free—able to decide how to spend an afternoon. This talk isn’t about addiction itself, but I share this so you understand how trapped I felt before I explain how my life became amazing.

I’m clean, first and foremost. (Applause) I’m married to an incredible man, and we work on all sorts of exciting projects together. I’m also the CEO of Astera Institute, a multibillion-dollar private foundation pioneering innovative approaches to science and technology. (Applause) Today, I want to talk about how I moved from point A to point B.

What changed? It wasn’t that I became smarter or worked harder. The change was more fundamental: I developed a sense of personal agency—the ability to recognize and act upon the degrees of freedom we actually have. It’s about finding hidden doors in life’s walls.

I argue that when it comes to living a meaningful life, agency matters more than traits we often consider critical, like intelligence or hard work. Both are nearly useless if misapplied—and increasingly less important as machines take over many tasks.

I recently saw a quote by Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator: *“Intelligence is on tap now, so agency is even more important.”* For all the freedom addiction took from me, it paradoxically gave me an advantage in cultivating agency. One key factor in developing agency is desperation.

Addicts call this *the gift of desperation*: the willingness to do whatever it takes to change your life, to embarrass yourself by standing before a roomful of strangers and saying, “My name is Cate, and I’m a drug addict.” Or to isolate yourself for months. Or take medications that could land you in the ER if you drink.

By the time I entered rehab, I had this gift. I had lost my job, most of my friends, and even my physical abilities for a time. When I left, I walked into a halfway house with a life in shambles. Yet, in a way, that was beneficial: I felt I had nothing left to lose.

That made me fearless and hungry. I said yes to every opportunity, every connection, even without knowing its benefit. That approach led me to meet most of the people I’ve worked with over the last four years.

Losing my pride accelerated my learning. Brain damage meant I often didn’t understand things, and I couldn’t pretend I did. I learned to say, *“I don’t understand what you just said. Can you explain it?”* in situations where I previously would have nodded along.

Side note: people love to explain things. (Laughter) It’s a total win-win.

Now, here’s good news: you don’t need to ruin your life to learn agency. Desperation helps, but everyone can find something to be desperate about. I experienced this during COVID, as friends and I watched low-income countries struggle with vaccine distribution due to inadequate cold-chain storage.

We created a company producing a shelf-stable vaccine and let our desperation drive us into clinical trials in under six months—faster than any start-up in history. I also felt another type of desperation early in my marriage, when an invisible wall seemed to separate us.

Through that desperation, I learned to overcome emotional barriers and connect with people. Agency isn’t innate, and most people acquire it through luck—sometimes the luck of desperation or witnessing someone highly agentic up close.

I believe agency can also be learned systematically. Here are some tactics I’ve found effective:

1. **Assume everything is learnable.** Traits we think are fixed—optimism, curiosity, relational skills—can be learned with the right effort.
2. **Court rejection.** Avoiding rejection limits growth. Aim for goals that feel unreasonable; it tests your instincts. Once, I told a few people, *“I’m thinking of starting an organization like yours. Can I run yours instead?”* (Laughter) A little delusional, perhaps—but sometimes delusion works.
3. **Seek honest feedback.** We all have blind spots that others can see. Providing a way for anonymous feedback can reveal them and accelerate growth. I linked an anonymous feedback box to my Twitter profile, and it has been life-changing.

If I could speak to myself five years ago, I would never have believed that I could one day enjoy such freedom: the ability to spend my afternoons as I wish, without hiding, and to feel genuinely happy.

That is the power of personal agency. No matter how trapped you feel, learning to locate your hidden doors can unlock unimaginable freedom.
