### ✨ **Revised Text (IELTS Band 9 Version)**

And we're fortunate to have partnered with the **Reliance Foundation** in **India**, which runs an outstanding **sports scholarship program**. Every year, they deploy scouts nationwide to identify the most promising **11-year-old athletes**, offering them **five-year scholarships** that include both **sports training** and **free education**. *The most exceptional among them often progress to play professional sports in India.*

However, the **challenge remains the same as with Chelsea FC**—a **limited number of scouts** can only observe a **few thousand players**, while **millions** are eligible. To overcome this limitation, Reliance turned to us to help identify **hard-to-reach talent** in remote regions.

They broadcasted a **WhatsApp call-to-action**, inviting parents and students to **download our app** and complete **AI-powered drills** directly on their phones to **trial for the Reliance Foundation** through **aiScout**.

Today, *tens of thousands of young athletes participate every year.* The best performers—determined through their **data-driven performance analytics**—are invited to an **in-person Talent ID day**, where scouts make final scholarship decisions.

It’s a *powerful demonstration of how technology can **augment**, not replace, traditional scouting methods.* One of our greatest success stories involved a player who **downloaded the app from a shared community phone**, had **never played organized sport**, and yet earned a **five-year scholarship** purely based on his **AI performance metrics**.

Only last year, the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)** and their partner, **Intel**, approached us ahead of the **Youth Olympics in Senegal**. They were concerned that the **Senegalese national teams** might not have enough athletes to fill all their squads.

Here’s where our technology truly shines. Using **computer vision** and **machine learning**, the aiScout app doesn’t just allow athletes to **trial for specific sports**, it also **recommends sports** best suited to their **biomechanical and physical strengths**.

*For example:*

* If an athlete shows **exceptional acceleration** and **reactive strength**, the AI might suggest **rugby sevens** or **futsal**.
* If they demonstrate **upper-body power** and **hand-eye coordination**, it may recommend **baseball** or **softball**.

To facilitate this, we **deployed tablets preloaded with the aiScout app** to **schoolteachers** and **military trainers**, who then recorded videos of students performing movement drills. Within days, thousands of children had participated, and **40 athletes were selected** for **training ahead of the Youth Olympics** in **sports such as wrestling, athletics, and football**.

So, where do we go from here?

Currently, the app operates through **global partnership programs**, **federations**, and **brand collaborations**, supporting large-scale **talent identification (Talent ID) initiatives**. *Hundreds of thousands of young athletes complete these AI-based drills annually, and many have already progressed to professional levels.*

Now, the platform is scaling **globally**—it’s **multi-language**, **multi-cloud**, and **region-adaptive**, allowing **country-specific customization**.

Right here in the **United States**, we’re proud to announce that **Major League Soccer (MLS)** has implemented aiScout in its **MLS NEXT program**.

Currently, **45,000 young athletes** use the app **three times a year**—during **preseason**, **mid-season**, and **postseason**—enabling us to **track their biomechanical changes and athletic progress** over time.

Scouts and coaches receive **real-time performance data** through our **centralized control dashboard**. *It’s not a black box—it’s a transparent, data-driven system that builds trust and provides clear insights into every metric we measure.*

And what’s next?

It’s not hard to imagine how this technology will soon extend into **at-home healthcare** and **rehabilitation monitoring**. We’re also building extensive **movement libraries** for **American football**, **basketball**, **baseball**, and **cricket**, using the concept of **movement primitives**—fundamental motion patterns like **cuts**, **jumps**, **decelerations**, **throws**, and **strikes**—that are shared across many sports.

Because in sport, one truth always remains:
*Talent is universal, and brilliance exists in every corner of the world.*

Now, with **AI**, **data analytics**, and **your very own smartphone**, *you can make that hidden talent visible and truly level the playing field.*
