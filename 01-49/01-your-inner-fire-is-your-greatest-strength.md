My parents met at the 1992 Earth Summit and bonded over years of climate advocacy, igniting a passion in me to champion environmental justice. As a child, I earned the title of Water Protector in kindergarten, ensuring faucets were turned off to conserve water. At 13, a toxic flood from the polluted Lerma River inundated my indigenous hometown, San Pedro Tultepec, revealing the climate crisis as a driver of social inequities, not just natural disasters.

This epiphany fueled my activism. At 15, I addressed the United Nations, highlighting the absence of youth voices in climate discussions. I co-organized a massive climate strike in New York City, rallying 300,000 people—far exceeding our permit for 17,000. The energy of collective action lit up my heart. However, the pandemic disrupted our momentum, and I faced burnout at 17, collapsing from stress while juggling activism, college applications, and negotiations with the Department of Education.

These challenges taught me two lessons. First, activism thrives on love and care, not just anger or fear. A bystander’s question during a strike—“Are you marching for or against something?”—prompted me to focus on positive change. Second, self-care is vital to sustain advocacy. Now, I channel my conviction through three tools for resilience:

1. **Reframing Narratives**: I reject apocalyptic climate forecasts, recognizing that many communities, like my indigenous one, have already endured systemic crises. We’re not doomed; we’re rebuilding with resilience.
2. **Learning from Nature**: Observing nature, like footprints in sand, teaches balance. Instead of chasing individual impact, I prioritize stewardship and harmony with ecosystems.
3. **Imagining Positive Futures**: I envision thriving ecosystems in 2050, where my grandchildren marvel at coral reefs and glaciers. This vivid optimism counters dystopian narratives.

My indigenous elders ask, “How is your fire?”—meaning my resolve. I urge you to nurture your own fire for environmental justice, walking each step with purpose toward a sustainable future. Together, we can build a world where life is valued, and our planet thrives.
