# Your Inner Fire Is Your Greatest Strength | Xiye Bastida

My parents **converged** at the 1992 Earth Summit and **forged a profound connection** through years of climate advocacy, *kindling an ardent zeal* in me to champion environmental justice. As a young child, I earned the *sobriquet* of Water Protector in kindergarten, diligently ensuring faucets were *shut off* to conserve precious resources. At 13, a *noxious deluge* from the contaminated Lerma River **inundated** my indigenous hometown, San Pedro Tultepec, *elucidating* the climate crisis as a *catalyst* for social *disparities*, not merely natural calamities.

This revelation **galvanized** my activism. At 15, I *orated* before the United Nations, *underscoring* the *paucity* of youth perspectives in climate dialogues. I *co-orchestrated* a *colossal* climate strike in New York City, *mobilizing* 300,000 individuals—vastly surpassing our permit for 17,000. The *fervor* of collective action *set my spirit ablaze*. Yet, the pandemic disrupted our momentum, and at 17, I *succumbed* to exhaustion, collapsing under the strain of balancing activism, college applications, and negotiations with the Department of Education.

These trials imparted two profound insights. First, activism flourishes through *compassion* and *empathy*, not solely *indignation* or *trepidation*. A bystander’s query during a strike—“Are you *rallying* for or against something?”—prompted me to *pivot toward* advocating positive transformation. Second, *self-care* is *indispensable* for sustaining advocacy. Now, I channel my conviction through three strategies for resilience:

1. **Reframing Narratives**: I *eschew* apocalyptic climate *prognostications*, acknowledging that many communities, like my indigenous one, have already endured systemic *cataclysms*. We are not *condemned*; we are *reconstructing* with *fortitude*.
2. **Drawing Wisdom from Nature**: Observing nature, such as footprints etched in sand, *imparts* lessons of *equilibrium*. Rather than pursuing individual *accolades*, I prioritize *stewardship* and *synergy* with ecosystems.
3. **Envisioning Auspicious Futures**: I *conjure* vibrant ecosystems in 2050, where my grandchildren marvel at *resplendent* coral reefs and *majestic* glaciers. This vivid optimism *counteracts* dystopian narratives.

My indigenous elders inquire, “How *burns* your fire?”—alluding to my *resolve*. I *exhort* you to *stoke* your own *fervor* for environmental justice, treading each step with *intention* toward a sustainable future. Collectively, we can *forge* a world where life is *cherished*, and our planet *flourishes*.
