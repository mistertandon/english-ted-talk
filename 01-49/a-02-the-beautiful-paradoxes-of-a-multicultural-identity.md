[The Beautiful Paradoxes of a Multicultural Identity | Farhad Mohit | TED - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjpaJpMd5NU)


I am deeply honored to be on this stage, representing TED's growing recognition of the significance of its immigrant diaspora community. As an Iranian-American, a sort of free-spirited Iranian, I feel privileged to be here with all of you, free to embrace the positive elements of my native culture—the poetry, music, philosophy, and hospitality—in ways that many Iranians within Iran cannot.

I also find profound fulfillment in the duality of my identity, straddling the seemingly disparate realms of "Iranian" and "American." This duality provides my life with a distinctive perspective. Today, I wish to share two quintessential American ideals that elucidate this multicultural dichotomy within me.

The first is independence. In America, independence is a cornerstone—a fundamental principle that underpins our freedom and instills a sense of exceptionalism in all Americans. In contrast to my Iranian heritage, where communal involvement is pervasive, I am free—perhaps even compelled—to pursue my own happiness, and that sense of liberation is exhilarating.

The second is the concept of continuous improvement—the notion that one can always strive for betterment. America is a dynamic, ever-evolving society, constantly innovating and reinventing itself. We make mistakes, yet we persist in our growth and development. This is what makes being an entrepreneur in America so thrilling—there are no limits to what we can endeavor to create.

For me, this spirit of innovation now manifests in my efforts to challenge our corrupt political duopoly and work towards democratizing democracy itself. Isn't it remarkable that, as an American, I can pursue this without fear or the need for permission? Yet, I am also Iranian, with the ancient wisdom of mystics like Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Rumi coursing through my veins.

These American ideals compel my Iranian psyche to pause and reflect. Independence is empowering, but if I am truly independent, do I not need anything or anyone? Such autonomy can lead to loneliness. Iranians are inherently hospitable and communal. In fact, the name "Iran" itself is derived from the word “yar,” meaning "friendship" or "love," and “ostan,” meaning "land of." A nod here to our cultural cousins in Ireland, another land of love. But where does this love and connection fit into my fiercely independent American psyche? Love necessitates connection and interdependence—concepts that seem almost antithetical to the American ethos. After all, Americans have never proclaimed a Declaration of Interdependence.

Here, my Iranian side urges a divergence in thought. As my beloved Sufi uncle Behzad would say, "Love is the ether in which the universe swims." Without love, we are bereft of meaning. So, should one choose to be independent, or to be in love? This is the cross-cultural conundrum I face. And what of the American ideal of continuous improvement? My American side finds it unquestionably productive.

Yet, my Iranian side poses a challenge. I recall a magnet on my mother's refrigerator that read: “If you’re ever going to be happy, you must be happy now.” This hints at an existential quandary: the present is all we ever have. And of course, the mystic poet Rumi exhorts us, in verse after verse, to abandon rationality and immerse ourselves in the ecstatic present.

So, should I work towards crafting a better future, or should I revel in the bliss of the present moment? Another multicultural paradox—or perhaps not. Perhaps I have been constructing a false dichotomy all along. There is no pure "Iranian" or "American" on this stage today, within me. I am not a mere model trained on a discrete set of cultural norms.

I am that still-magical, mystical, fractal of universal consciousness known as a human being. I am a point—thank you—a point at the center and circumference of an infinite sphere, as my favorite author, the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges, once wrote. As a magical, mystical lifeform—a MML—we humans are uniquely free to embody whichever paradoxes serve us best, whenever they suit us.

We can choose to be culturally American, Iranian, or both, irrespective of our origins, and can even favor an author who belongs to neither culture. As an MML, we can simultaneously be independent and free while being deeply interconnected through love with everyone and everything—striving for a better future, while also finding joy together, here, now, in this moment of wonder.
