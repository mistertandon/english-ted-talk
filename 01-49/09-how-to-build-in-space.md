A professor once **brought up** the question, *“Why pour resources into space exploration when Earth grapples with pressing crises?”* It’s a **legitimate** query, but I contend the rationale is unequivocal: space exploration **spurs** technological breakthroughs that **redound to the benefit of** terrestrial life.

My **fascination** with flight is deeply **ingrained**—both of my parents served as Air Force aviators, and encountering microgravity 14 years ago **set me off on** my aerospace odyssey. Space programs have already **churned out** groundbreaking innovations: modern computing stemmed from Apollo, LASIK eye surgery **emerged from** the ISS, and now, biotechnology and solar energy **are taking off** in orbit.

Space access has become markedly more **attainable**. Launch expenses have **come down** precipitously—from \$50,000/kg to under \$200/kg, thanks to SpaceX’s Starship. Yet, our principal orbital laboratory—the ISS—has grown **obsolete** and is scheduled to be **phased out** by 2031. Existing construction protocols in orbit remain **arduous**, **hazardous**, and **inefficient**, thereby **holding back** our advancement.

To **tackle** this bottleneck, my team at the Aurelia Institute has **brought forth** Tesserae: a modular, autonomously self-assembling space habitat utilizing **electropermanent magnets**. These magnetic tiles **lock into place** in orbit—no astronauts or robotic interventions required. We've already **carried out** two successful test missions in space.

Our vision **transcends** mere habitation. In low-Earth orbit, we’re **setting up** biotech manufacturing hubs where protein crystallization diverges, tissues **mature at an accelerated pace**, and pharmaceutical discovery is **propelled forward**. We're also **collaborating with** clean-energy ventures to **lay out** orbital solar arrays—transmitting sustainable power back to Earth, even nocturnally.

This endeavor is not about **getting away from** Earth—it’s about **offloading** heavy industry to safeguard it. By **scaling up** orbital infrastructure, we **pave the way for** a sustainable future—both above and below.

Let’s **harness** space for the betterment of Earth.
